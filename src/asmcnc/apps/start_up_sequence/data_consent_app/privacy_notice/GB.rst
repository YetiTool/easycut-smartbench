Privacy Notice and Data Collection Policy
==========================================


This is the privacy notice of Yeti Tool Ltd. In this document, "we", "our", or "us" refer to Yeti Tool Ltd.
We are company number 11310906 registered in England and Wales.
Our registered office is at Unit 12 Old Mill Road, Portishead, Bristol BS20 7BX.


Introduction
------------

This privacy notice aims to inform you about how we collect and process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information. It tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

We are committed to protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information. Our policy is not just an exercise in complying with the law, but a continuation of our respect for you and your personal information.

We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate.

Our policy complies with UK law accordingly implemented, including that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regards to the processing and control of your personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the information provided at http://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org

Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through the console on SmartBench.


1. Data Protection Officer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for ensuring that our policy is followed.

If you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact our DPO, Andy McLaren at andy.mclaren@yetitool.com.


2. Data we process
++++++++++++++++++

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of anonymous data about your SmartBench’s working. 

Data that we may collect includes your internet protocol (IP) address, job critical event data, maintenance data, and your console hostname. 

We may aggregate anonymous data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Anonymous data is data that does not identify you as an individual. Aggregated data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal information in law because it does not reveal your identity.

However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal information so that it can identify you in any way, we treat the combined data as personal information and it will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.

IP address
~~~~~~~~~~

This is your public or WAN IP address. This will be treated as personal information. 

Job critical event data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This constitutes machine data relating to job critical SmartBench events including GRBL alarms, GRBL errors, spindle overload, power loss and any other events that may cause the job to fail. 

Maintenance data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This constitutes data that may relate to maintenance schedules and running of SmartBench. This data may include runtime and uptime, maintenance statistics (e.g. how often brushes are replaced), feeds and speeds, and other anonymous usage data. 

Console hostname
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a unique identifier for your Console that is used to link your SmartBench with Yeti Tool services including SmartManager. The Console hostname is not recorded alongside or aggregated with other identifiable data such as serial numbers or customer contact information.


The bases on which we process information about you
---------------------------------------------------

The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.

If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately stop processing your data.

If the basis changes then if required by law we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to process your information.


3. Information we process because we have a contractual obligation with you
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you accept the terms on the console software or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.

In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us. 

We may use it in order to:

	• provide you with our services
	• provide you with suggestions and advice on machine operation or servicing

We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.

We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.


4. Information we process with your consent
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you have given us explicit permission to do so by accepting the terms and conditions of the software update, we may from time to time pass your name and contact information to selected associates whom we consider may provide services.

We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent or it can be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.

You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at sales@yetitool.com. However, if you do so, you may not be able to use our website or our services further.


5. Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.

Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:

	• whether the same objective could be achieved through other means
	• whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm
	• whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so

For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:

	• Your Customer Support
	• responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response
	• protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party
	• insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage Yeti Tool Ltd’s risk
	• protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so
	• machine usage analytics that help us improve our services to you


Specific uses of information you provide to us
----------------------------------------------

6. Communicating with us
++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you contact us, whether by telephone, through our website or by e-mail, we collect the data you have given to us in order to reply with the information you need.

We record your request and our reply in order to increase the efficiency of our business.

We keep personally identifiable information associated with your message, such as your name and email address so as to be able to track our communications with you to provide a high quality service.


7. Complaining
++++++++++++++

When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us.

We use that information to resolve your complaint.

If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that information is.

We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.


Other matters
-------------

8. How you can complain
+++++++++++++++++++++++

If you are not happy with our privacy policy or if you have any complaint then you should tell us.

If a dispute is not settled then we hope you will agree to attempt to resolve it by engaging in good faith with us in a process of mediation or arbitration. 

If you are in any way dissatisfied about how we process your personal information, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). This can be done at https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about your concern before you approach the ICO.


9. Compliance with the law
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Our privacy policy has been compiled so as to comply with the law of every country or legal jurisdiction in which we aim to do business. If you think it fails to satisfy the law of your jurisdiction, we should like to hear from you.

It is ultimately your choice as to whether you wish to accept this privacy policy, and whether you enable your SmartBench Console to send data via Wi-Fi. When your Console Wi-Fi is enabled, this will indicate that you have consented to the terms of data usage as outlined in this privacy notice.

10. Review of this privacy policy
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We may update this privacy notice from time to time as necessary. The terms that apply to you are those stored on your SmartBench Console on the day that you use your SmartBench Console.

If you have any questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us.
