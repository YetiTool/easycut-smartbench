Connection Hints
================

If you are having trouble connecting the console to your wifi network, read these notes:


Network name and password
-------------------------

* **Password MUST be between 8 and 63 characters.**

* Both will be case sensitive, make sure they are exact.

* Avoid the need for any special characters.

* Make sure there are no extra spaces.


Country code
------------

Make sure the country code matches. Default is GB which is fairly universal, but may not suit some regions. See the Country Codes section below for the correct code for your region.


Pressing the Connect button
---------------------------

Check all details are exact.

* On releasing the Connect button, the console will need to reboot before attempting to establish a connection using the network name and password details entered.

* Time to connect

* Some routers can take a several minutes to connect

* Connecting via a wifi router

* If you are having problems, reset and restart the router.

* Make sure the console is in range - you can use a wifi scanner app to check signal.

* Some routers offer a choice between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels. 5 GHz channels can be less reliable, therefore we advise connecting over the 2.4 GHz channel wherever possible.


Connecting via a mobile hotspot
-------------------------------

We have seen issues trying to connect over Apple devices. We advise connecting over Android where possible.


Apple devices

To connect to an Apple device, try the following steps.

* Power off SmartBench

* When iPhone restarts, connect USB cable from iPhone into the USB port on the SmartBench console

* Turn on your iPhone hotspot (Settings>personal hotspot)

* Power on SmartBench
