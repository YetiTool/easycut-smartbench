    """
    The ButtonBase class is the base class for all our buttons we use in our screens and apps. It offers base functionality that every button needs e.g. setting the size so that every button looks the same.

    Base classes:
     - kivy.uix.Button
     - HoverBehaviour (to be implemented)

    Additional notes:
    This is an abstract class and must not be instantiated directly!
