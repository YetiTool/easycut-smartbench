Z raise at end of homing sequence
====================================

SmartBenches manufactured from June 2023 will have a slightly different Z Head configuration.

This release adds a small Z lift at the end of the homing sequence, which ensures that all users can immediately access the spindle motor clamping crossbolt, without having to do a manual move. 

This release also contains some technical improvements, bug fixes, and the foundations for new features (watch this space!).
