Graphical patch, draggable keyboard, and preparing for the next big thing…
=================================================================================

The keyboard can now be moved around the screen, and converted into a number pad by pressing the button to the right of the spacebar.

This release also contains a patch for some of the graphical issues that users were seeing, including greyed out text and the rainbow splash screen.

We’ve also been working in the background on setting up for the next big thing, watch this space!
