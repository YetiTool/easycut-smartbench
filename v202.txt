Lowered default spindle cooldown RPM, and added override functionality
======================================================================

The default spindle cooldown RPM has been lowered to 12,000 RPM for YETI spindles, and 10,000 RPM for AMB spindles. 

If you previously set a custom value for the spindle cooldown RPM, you will need to set it again to override the new default settings. You can go to the Maintenance app to do this. 


Updating from a version earlier than v2.0.0?
