Platform script patch
==================================
Some users were seeing an issue where the previous releaseâ€™s port change was not applied if they did not have a stable network connection. 

Earlier tasks in the script that manages the port change could fail without a network connection, and that caused the port change task to not run. 

This has now been patched.
