Improvements
====================

SmartManager and SmartTransfer metadata timestamps will now be local to your region. 

Some users with slow or unstable internet connections may have experienced Console slowness immediately after sending job feedback, and at start-up. This has now been patched. 

There are changes to how job file metadata is updated. If SmartBench loses power while file metadata is being updated after a job, you should transfer a new copy of that file and check it. Check the online release notes to learn more about this. 

Updating from a version earlier than v2.0.0? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Console update is part of the new SmartManager package!

SmartManager is a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) that provides essential real-time data to the whole production team, to streamline workflow and maximise productivity.
