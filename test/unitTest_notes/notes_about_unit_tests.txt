Very little to note here.

1. Expect test folder to be a different folder to source files /src/
2. Unit tests to inherit objects from, run on and check functionality of specific bits of src code
3. tbc on Python packages to run this as yet.
4. BDD likely to be used - Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
5. BDD uses simple phrases note a scenario that is tested:
6. E.g.    GIVEN - the SmartBench has started
           WHEN the user presses X button
           THEN y happens
           
           Note the use of GIVEN WHEN and THEN as keywords.
