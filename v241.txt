Precision Pro + upgrade capability, and YetiPilot improvements - with patch
=============================================================================

This is a patch for the YetiPilot release, v2.4.0: we’ve added units (mm) back into cutter diameter and step down fields for all profiles.

v2.4.0 gives existing owners of SmartBench V1.3 the ability to upgrade their machines to Precision Pro + with an upgrade kit.

It also includes YetiPilot improvements, including a Spindle motor health check and an increased range of profiles. 

Not a Precision Pro + user? That’s ok, you’ll be seeing smarter features in the near future too!
