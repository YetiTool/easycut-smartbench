Spindle speed protections, improved YetiPilot, and bug fixes
===================================================================

Improvements to the accuracy of spindle speed have meant that the minimum spindle speed has changed; warnings have been put in place in the file check to reflect this.

The minimum spindle speed is 4,000 RPM for 230V spindles, and 10,000 RPM for 120V spindles.

MDF and Hardwood Plywood YetiPilot profiles have been refined due to improved testing.
