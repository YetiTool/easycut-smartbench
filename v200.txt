============================

This Console update is part of the new SmartManager package. 

SmartManager is a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) that provides essential real-time data to the whole production team to streamline workflow and maximise productivity.

From the Console, the operator is now able to:

|**•** | See information about individual jobs from the filechooser screens, including SmartManager metadata.                                                 |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|**•** | When a job has been loaded, see further information that has been gathered from the G-Code file, including feeds, speeds, and comments in the file.  |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|**•** | Send feedback to SmartManager after a job, including batch numbers, production notes, and details of any critical events that occurred during a job. |
+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

If you are not using SmartManager, this update still comes with some new features, including G-Code preview and summary in the PRO app, which allows you to se|e details about your file before you run it. 

In order to work with SmartManager, your Console will now send anonymous machine data to Yeti Tool. The next few screens will tell you more about this, and you will be able to choose whether to accept the data policy and allow the Console to send data to Yeti Tool.
