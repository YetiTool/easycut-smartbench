Patches
========

**Patch for the lag that happens if Console is connected to an unstable or lagging network.**

Some users were experiencing lag on their Consoles after the updating to v1.8.0. 

This was caused by changes to the way that the Console checked its internet connection. If the Console was connected to a slower or more unstable connection, its background check would take longer, and briefly lock up the user interface. 

This has now been patched.
